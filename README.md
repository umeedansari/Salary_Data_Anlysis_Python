# Overview

Welcome to my analysis of the data job market, focusing on data analyst roles. This project was created out of a desire to navigate and understand the job market more effectively. It delves into the top-paying and in-demand skills to help find optimal job opportunities for data analysts.

The data sourced from [Luke Barousse's Python Course](https://lukebarousse.com/python) which provides a foundation for my analysis, containing detailed information on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills. Through a series of Python scripts, I explore key questions such as the most demanded skills, salary trends, and the intersection of demand and salary in data analytics.

# The Questions

Below are the questions I want to answer in my project:

1. What are the skills most in demand for the top 3 most popular data roles?
2. How are in-demand skills trending for Data Analysts?
3. How well do jobs and skills pay for Data Analysts?
4. What are the optimal skills for data analysts to learn? (High Demand AND High Paying) 

# Tools I Used

For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **Python:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to analyze the data and find critical insights.I also used the following Python libraries:
    - **Pandas Library:** This was used to analyze the data. 
    - **Matplotlib Library:** I visualized the data.
    - **Seaborn Library:** Helped me create more advanced visuals. 
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** The tool I used to run my Python scripts which let me easily include my notes and analysis.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for executing my Python scripts.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my Python code and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# Data Preparation and Cleanup

This section outlines the steps taken to prepare the data for analysis, ensuring accuracy and usability.

## Import & Clean Up Data

I start by importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset, followed by initial data cleaning tasks to ensure data quality.

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import ast
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load the dataset
data = load_dataset("lukebarousse/data_jobs")

# Convert the train split to a pandas DataFrame
df = data["train"].to_pandas()

# Convert job_posted_date to datetime format
df["job_posted_date"] = pd.to_datetime(df["job_posted_date"])

# Convert job_skills from string representation of list to actual list
df["job_skills"] = df["job_skills"].apply(lambda x: ast.literal_eval(x) if pd.notna(x) else x)

```

## Filter US Jobs

To focus my analysis on the U.S. job market, I apply filters to the dataset, narrowing down to roles based in the United States.

```python
df_US = df[df['job_country'] == 'United States']

```

# The Analysis

Each Jupyter notebook for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data job market. Hereâ€™s how I approached each question:

## 1. What are the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles?

To find the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles. I filtered out those positions by which ones were the most popular, and got the top 5 skills for these top 3 roles. This query highlights the most popular job titles and their top skills, showing which skills I should pay attention to depending on the role I'm targeting.

### Visualize Data

```python
fig,ax=plt.subplots(3,1)
sns.set_theme(style='ticks')
for i,title in enumerate(roles):
    df_plot=merged[merged['job_title_short']==title].head()
    sns.barplot(data=df_plot,x='percentage',y="job_skills",ax=ax[i],hue='count',palette="dark:b_r",legend=False)
    ax[i].set_title(title)
    ax[i].set_ylabel('')
    ax[i].set_xlim(0,78)
    ax[i].set_ylabel('')
    for v,n in enumerate(df_plot['percentage']):
        ax[i].text(n+1,v,f"{n:.0f}%",va="center")
    if i !=len(roles)-1 :
        ax[i].set_xticks([])  


plt.tight_layout()    
```

## 3. How well do jobs and skills pay for Data Analysts?

To identify the highest-paying roles and skills, I only got jobs in the United States and looked at their median salary. But first I looked at the salary distributions of common data jobs like Data Scientist, Data Engineer, and Data Analyst, to get an idea of which jobs are paid the most. 

View my notebook with detailed steps here: 4_Salary_Analysis.

#### Visualize Data 

```python
sns.boxplot(data=df_fil,x='salary_year_avg',y="job_title_short",order=job_order)
sns.set_theme(style='ticks')
sns.despine()
plt.title('Salary Distributions of Data Jobs in the US')
plt.xlabel('Yearly Salary (USD)')
plt.ylabel('')
plt.xlim(0, 600000) 
ticks_x = plt.FuncFormatter(lambda y, pos: f'${int(y/1000)}K')
plt.gca().xaxis.set_major_formatter(ticks_x)
plt.show()

```

Senior roles (Senior Data Scientist, Senior Data Engineer) not only have higher median salaries but also larger differences in typical salaries, reflecting greater variance in compensation as responsibilities increase.

### Highest Paid & Most Demanded Skills for Data Analysts

Next, I narrowed my analysis and focused only on data analyst roles. I looked at the highest-paid skills and the most in-demand skills. I used two bar charts to showcase these.

#### Visualize Data

```python

fig, ax = plt.subplots(2, 1)  

# Top 10 Highest Paid Skills for Data Analysts
sns.barplot(data=by_median, x='median', y=by_median.index, hue='median', ax=ax[0], palette='dark:b_r')
ax[0].legend().remove()
# original code:
# df_DA_top_pay[::-1].plot(kind='barh', y='median', ax=ax[0], legend=False) 
ax[0].set_title('Highest Paid Skills for Data Analysts in the US')
ax[0].set_ylabel('')
ax[0].set_xlabel('')
ax[0].xaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda x, _: f'${int(x/1000)}K'))


# Top 10 Most In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts')
sns.barplot(data=by_count, x='median', y=by_count.index, hue='median', ax=ax[1], palette='light:b')
ax[1].legend().remove()
# original code:
# df_DA_skills[::-1].plot(kind='barh', y='median', ax=ax[1], legend=False)
ax[1].set_title('Most In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts in the US')
ax[1].set_ylabel('')
ax[1].set_xlabel('Median Salary (USD)')
ax[1].set_xlim(ax[0].get_xlim())  # Set the same x-axis limits as the first plot
ax[1].xaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda x, _: f'${int(x/1000)}K'))

sns.set_theme(style='ticks')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

```

#### Results

Here's the breakdown of the highest-paid & most in-demand skills for data analysts in the US:

## 4. What are the most optimal skills to learn for Data Analysts?

To identify the most optimal skills to learn ( the ones that are the highest paid and highest in demand) I calculated the percent of skill demand and the median salary of these skills. To easily identify which are the most optimal skills to learn. 

View my notebook with detailed steps here: 5_Optimal_Skills.

#### Visualize Data

```python
sns.scatterplot(data=df_plot,x='percent',y='median')
text=[]
for i,n in enumerate(df_plot.index):
   text.append(plt.text(x=df_plot['percent'].iloc[i],y=df_plot['median'].iloc[i],s=n))

from adjustText import adjust_text
adjust_text(text, arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='->', color='gray'))
plt.xlabel('Percent of Data Analyst Jobs')
plt.ylabel('Median Salary ($USD)')  # Assuming this is the label you want for y-axis
plt.title('Most Optimal Skills for Data Analysts in the US')

# Get current axes, set limits, and format axes
ax = plt.gca()
ax.yaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda y, pos: f'${int(y/1000)}K'))  # Example formatting y-axis
from matplotlib.ticker import PercentFormatter 
plt.gca().xaxis.set_major_formatter(PercentFormatter(decimals=0))
